# SMS Spam Classification using Machine Learning

This repository contains code for a machine learning project aimed at classifying SMS messages as either spam or not spam (ham). The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to build an effective spam detection model.


## Introduction

Spam messages are a common nuisance in SMS communication. Detecting and filtering out these messages is crucial for ensuring a better user experience and protecting against potential security threats. This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying SMS messages as spam or ham.

## Key Features

1. **Dataset**: Includes a labeled dataset of SMS messages, with examples of both spam and ham messages. The dataset is preprocessed and ready for training.
2. **Preprocessing**: Code for preprocessing the raw SMS data, including text normalization, tokenization, stop word removal, and vectorization using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
3. **Model Building**: Implementation of machine learning algorithm of Naive Bayes The algorithm is implemented and evaluated for its performance in classifying spam messages accurately.
4. **Evaluation**: Metrics and visualization tools to evaluate the performance of the models, including accuracy and precision. Cross-validation techniques are also employed to ensure robust evaluation.
5. **Deployment**: Guidance on deploying the trained model for real-time classification of incoming SMS messages. This could include deployment on web applications, mobile apps, or other platforms.
